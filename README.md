2. Read data.
3. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
4. Extract measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
6. Label the data set with descriptive variable names.
7. Create a tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
8. Write the data set to the tidy_data.txt file.
