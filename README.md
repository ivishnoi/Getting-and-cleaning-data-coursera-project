"Coursera-Getting and cleaning data course project"
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

>> Download and unzip source data if it doesn't exist.
>> Read data.
>> Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
>> Extract measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
>> Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
>> Label the data set with descriptive variable names.
>> Create a tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
>> Write the data set to the tidy_data.txt file.
